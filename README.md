## Under the Covers

Like most [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) directives,
this package revolves around a largely-consistent but
[undocumented](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindowsAndRegisters)
internal feature: the ability to use multi-character register
names. This feature was brought to my attention by attention by Magnar
Sveen, who you can say provided the
[inspiration](http://whattheemacsd.com/setup-magit.el-01.html) that
eventually became this project. The ability to create
officially-unrecognized register names means the chance of a collision
with user data in the same register is almost zero.

`bury-successful-compilation` works by saving the current window
configuration to a register before each compilation. If a compilation
fails, the saved state is not restored until the build succeeds
again. This means after an attempted compilation, you can thrash your
window configuration to chase down the compile-time issue, because
when the build succeeds you will be popped up the stack back to the
saved window configuration, right before your unsuccessful compilation
attempt.
